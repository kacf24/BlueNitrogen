Global sedimentary nitrogen and phosphorus stocks in seagrass meadows

URL of dataset
Forthcoming upon decision at the first review stage (planned public release via GitHub and an assigned DOI through an Zenodo)

Abstract
This dataset compiles global observations of sedimentary nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks beneath seagrass meadows to quantify their magnitude, variability, and vulnerability to meadow loss. Data were synthesized from published literature spanning nearly all seagrass bioregions and major taxa. Measurements include sediment nutrient concentrations, bulk density (when available), sampling depth, geographic location, and species composition, standardized to areal stocks (Mg ha⁻¹) and normalized to a 1-m sediment depth. The dataset supports analyses of global nutrient inventories, stoichiometric relationships, and modeling of nutrient release under different seagrass loss scenarios, providing a foundation for integrating “blue nitrogen” and “blue phosphorus” into coastal biogeochemical and management frameworks.

General study design
Global literature synthesis and data compilation of published field measurements of sedimentary nitrogen and phosphorus in seagrass meadows, combined with numerical modeling to assess nutrient stability under meadow loss scenarios.

Methods description
A systematic literature review following PRISMA-EcoEVO guidelines was conducted using Google Scholar, Scopus, and PubMed to identify studies reporting sediment N and/or P in seagrass meadows. Data were extracted from text, tables, figures, and supplemental materials. When bulk density was not reported, a global average value for seagrass sediments was applied (Fourqurean et al. 2012). All measurements were converted to areal stocks (Mg ha⁻¹) and standardized to a 1-m sediment depth. Associated metadata (location, species, depth, bioregion) were recorded for each observation. Data were aggregated for global analyses and used to parameterize a box model evaluating nutrient sequestration and release under different seagrass loss scenarios.

Laboratory, field, or other analytical methods
Sediment nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were originally measured in source studies using standard elemental analysis techniques (e.g., combustion elemental analyzers for N, colorimetric or ICP-based methods for P following digestion). Areal stocks were calculated by multiplying concentration by dry bulk density and sediment depth. Log-normal transformations were applied where appropriate for statistical analyses. Modeled outputs were generated using Monte Carlo simulations parameterized with literature-derived burial rates, loss rates, and sediment disturbance depths.

Taxonomic species or groups
Seagrasses (marine angiosperms), including genera Zostera, Thalassia, Halodule, Syringodium, Cymodocea, Posidonia, Halophila, and Enhalus.

Quality control
All extracted data were checked for unit consistency, transcription errors, and geographic accuracy. Values were standardized to common units and depths. Outliers were evaluated against original sources.
